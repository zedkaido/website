	<h2>Mother Fucking License (MFL)</h2>

	<p>
		All of this shit is under this 
		<b><a href="/LICENSE.txt" target="_blank">Mother Fucking License</a></b>.
	</p>

	<p>And, it's fucking perfect.</p>

	<h3>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h3>

	<p>
		This shit is public as fuck. Any motherfucker in the universe can use it.
		It's part of the public domain, you sick fuck. And, it's for you own fucking
		good.
	</p>

	<h3>That's right, motherfucker:</h3>

	<p>
		You can use this shit in any way, shape or form.
		<b> Download. Copy. Fork. Use. Modify. Publish. Distribute. </b>
		Go ahead. I give you permission to do whatever the fuck you want with it.
		That is, if you have the brains to do anything with this shitty
		masterpiece. You can even stick it in your motherfucking ass, I don't give
		a fuck. Throw it into the interwebs. Share it on your shitty social medias.
		If you are an indecent son-of-a-bitch, you don't even have to mention that
		I made this. Go on. Claim it as yours, motherfucker. I don't fucking care.
	</p>

	<p>
		I bet this is the only license that gets the fucking point across. And yet,
		you still think I'm gonna sue you. Get your shitty shit together. You really
		think I'm gonna waste my fucking time and money running after you? Wrong,
		motherfucker. If you do shitty things with this, I will personally come to
		your house and beat your stinky ass. So if you dare use this, use it for the
		good of this fucked up world, you smurf.
